# React Portfolio

## Description

This is a portfolio created using React. It is a single page application that uses React components to render the page. Sections include, About, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume. It uses conditional rendering. In addition, there are checks on the contact page to make sure the user inputs a valid email and message.  I learned a lot about useState and useEffect during this project as well as passing in props to components.
